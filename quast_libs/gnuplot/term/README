DOCUMENTATION FOR GNUPLOT TERMINAL DRIVER WRITERS
By Russell Lang 1/90
Updated for new file layout by drd 4/95
Paragraphs about inclusion of TERM_HELP added by rcc 1/96

No change to the interface between gnuplot and the terminal drivers,
but we would like to make the terminal drivers standalone

1) in order move the support for the terminal drivers outside of the
   support for the main program, thereby encouraging a library of
   contributed drivers
2) To make it easy for users to add contributed drivers, by adding
   a single #include line to term.h

Whole of terminal driver should be contained in one <driver>.trm file,
with a fairly strict layout as detailed below - this allows the
gnuplot maintainers to change the way the terminal drivers are
compiled without having to change the drivers themselves.
A few routines shared by multiple terminal drivers are given their
own C file, for example .../term/write_png_image.c.

term.h, and therefore each file.trm file, may be loaded more than once,
with different sections selected by macros.

Each driver provides all the functions it needs, and a table of
function pointers and other data to interface to gnuplot.
The table entry is currently defined as follows in term_api.h:

struct TERMENTRY {

/* required entries */

    const char *name;
    const char *description;
    unsigned int xmax,ymax,v_char,h_char,v_tic,h_tic;

};

One consequence of (1) is that we would like drivers to be backwards
compatible - drivers in the correct form below should work in future
versions of gnuplot without change. ISO C guarantees to fill uninitialised
members of a static structure to zero, so gnuplot can detect old drivers,
in which fields have not been initialised, and can point new interface entry
pointers to dummy functions.

We can add fields to the terminal structure, but only at the end of the list.
If you design a terminal that can't work without a new interface being defined,
and consequent changes to the main gnuplot source, please contact
gnuplot-beta@lists.sourceforge.net simply to ensure that you have the most
up to date definition of the terminal structure. Also, please ensure that
the 'set term' command checks for 0 values in added fields when an
old driver is selected, and a pointer to a suitable 'can't do' function
is provided. It is therefore not required (and in fact not possible)
to add padding fields to the end of all drivers.

Similarly, if you add an optional field to an old driver, take care
to ensure that all intervening fields are padded with zeros.

Some of the above fields are required - this should not be a problem,
since they were all required in earlier releases of gnuplot.
The later fields are interfaces to capabilities that not all devices
can do, or for which the generic routines provided should be adequate.
There are several null ('can't do') functions provided by term.c which
a driver can reference in the table. Similarly, for bitmap devices, there
are generic routines for lines and text provided by bitmap.c



Here's a brief description of each variable:

The char *name is a pointer to a string containing the name
of the terminal.  This name is used by the 'set terminal' and 
'show terminal' commands.  
The name must be unique and must not be confused with an abbreviation 
of another name.  For example if the name "postscript" exists, it is not
possible to have another name "postscript2".
Keep the name under 15 characters.

The char *description is a pointer to a string containing a
description of the terminal, which is displayed in response
to the 'set terminal' command.  
Keep the description under 60 characters.

xmax is the maximum number of points in the x direction.  
The range of points used by gnuplot is 0 to xmax-1.

ymax is the maximum number of points in the y direction.  
The range of points used by gnuplot is 0 to ymax-1.

v_char is the height of characters, in the same units as xmax and ymax.
v_char is used as the vertical line spacing for characters.
v_char and h_char should be updated by set_font() since they are 
needed for the core routines to estimate how much space will be
required for a text element.

h_char is the width of characters, in the same units as xmax and ymax.
The border for labelling at the left and right of the plot is 
calculated using h_char, for example.
If the _justify_text function returns FALSE, h_char is used to justify 
text right or centre.  If characters are not fixed width, then the 
_justify_text function must correctly justify the text.

v_tic is the vertical size of tics along the x axis, 
in the same units as ymax.

h_tic is the horizontal size of tics along the y axis, 
in the same units as xmax.

v_tic and h_tic should give tics of the same physical size on the
output. The ratio of these two quantities is used by gnuplot to set the
aspect ratio to 1 so that circles appear circular when 'set size square'
is active.

All the above values need not be static - values can be substituted
into the table during terminal initialisation, based on options for
example.



Here's a brief description of what each term.c function does:

_options()  Called when terminal type is selected.  Also called by
'set termoption'. The two cases can be distinguished because on entry
the value of c_token is either 3 or 2, respectively.
This procedure should parse options on the command line.  A list of the 
currently selected options should be stored in term_options[] in a form 
suitable for use with the set term command.  term_options[] is used by 
the save command.  Use options_null() if no options are available.
_options() and _waitforinput() are the only terminal functions that may
be called prior to _init(), so they must take not to perform actions
that require previous initialisation.

_init()  Called once, when the device is first selected.  This procedure
should set up things that only need to be set once, like handshaking and
character sets etc...
There is a global variable 'pointsize' which you might want to use here.
If set pointsize is issued after init has been called, the pointsize()
function is called.

_reset()  Called when gnuplot is exited, the output device changed or
the terminal type changed.  This procedure should reset the device, 
possibly flushing a buffer somewhere or generating a form feed.

_scale(xs,ys) Called just before _graphics(). This takes the x and y
scaling factors as information. If the terminal would like to do its
own scaling, it returns TRUE. Otherwise, it can ignore the information
and return FALSE: do_plot will do the scaling for you. null_scale is
provided to do just this, so most drivers can ignore this function.
PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS INTERFACE - IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MULTIPLOT.

_graphics()  Called just before a plot is going to be displayed.  This
procedure should set the device into graphics mode.  Devices which can't
be used as terminals (like plotters) will probably be in graphics mode 
always and therefore won't need this.

_text()  Called immediately after a plot is displayed.  This procedure 
should set the device back into text mode if it is also a terminal, so
that commands can be seen as they're typed.  Again, this will probably
do nothing if the device can't be used as a terminal. This call can
be used to trigger conversion and output for bitmap devices.

_move(x,y)  Called at the start of a line.  The cursor should move to the
(x,y) position without drawing.

_vector(x,y)  Called when a line is to be drawn.  This should display a line
from the last (x,y) position given by _move() or _vector() to this new (x,y)
position.

_linetype(lt)  Called to set the line type before text is displayed or
line(s) plotted.  This procedure should select a pen color or line
style if the device has these capabilities.  
Non-negative lt values correspond to a "real" linetype.
Negative lt values correspond to special values as defined in term_api.h
#define LT_AXIS       (-1)		/* Used to draw X and Y axes */
#define LT_BLACK      (-2)
#define LT_NODRAW     (-3)
#define LT_BACKGROUND (-4)
#define LT_UNDEFINED  (-5)
#define LT_COLORFROMCOLUMN  (-6)	/* Used by hidden3d code */
#define LT_DEFAULT    (-7)
#define LT_SINGLECOLOR  (-8)		/* Used by hidden3d code */
If _linetype() is called with lt greater than the available line types, 
it should map it to one of the available line types.

_put_text(x,y,str)  Called to display text at the (x,y) position, 
while in graphics mode.   The text should be vertically (with respect 
to the text) justified about (x,y).  The text is rotated according 
to _text_angle and then horizontally (with respect to the text)
justified according to _justify_text.


The following are optional


_text_angle(ang)  Called to rotate the text angle when placing the y label.
Ang is the rotation angle in degrees. If ang = 0 then text is horizontal.  
Returns TRUE if text can be rotated, FALSE otherwise.
[But you must return TRUE if called with ang=0]

_justify_text(mode)  Called to justify text left, right or centre.
If mode = LEFT then text placed by _put_text is flushed left against (x,y).
If mode = CENTRE then centre of text is at (x,y).  
If mode = RIGHT then text is placed flushed right against (x,y).
Returns TRUE if text can be justified
Returns FALSE otherwise and then _put_text assumes text is flushed left;
justification of text is then performed by calculating the text width
using strlen(text) * h_char.

_point(x,y,point)  Called to place a point at position (x,y).
point is -1 or an integer from 0 upwards.  
At least 6 point types (numbered 0 to 5) are normally provided.  
Point type -1 is a dot. 'point' corresponds to (pointtype - 1),
e.g. 'plot x with points pointtype 2' will call _point(x, y, 1).
If possible, the driver should support the following 13 point types
in the given order:

    point  pointtype
	0          1  plus
	1          2  X
	2          3  star
	3          4  box
	4          5  box                   filled
	5          6  circle
	6          7  circle (disk)         filled
	7          8  triangle
	8          9  triangle              filled
	9         10  upside down triangle
       10         11  upside down triangle  filled
       11         12  diamond
       12         13  diamond               filled

If point is more than the available point types then it should 
be mapped back to one of the available points.
Two _point() functions called do_point() and line_and_point() are 
provided in term.c and should be suitable for most drivers.  
do_point() draws the points in the current line type.
If your driver uses dotted line types (generally because it is
monochrome), you should use line_and_point() which changes to 
line type 0 before drawing the point.  line type 0 should be solid.

There is a global variable 'pointsize' which is controlled by the
set pointsize command. If possible, use that. pointsize should be
examined at terminal init. If it is subsequently changed, the
pointsize() function will be called.


_arrow(sx,sy,ex,ey,head)  Called to draw an arrow from (sx,sy) to (ex,ey).
A head is drawn on the arrow if head = TRUE.
An _arrow() function called do_arrow() is provided in term.c which will
draw arrows using the _move() and _vector() functions.  
Drivers should use do_arrow unless it causes problems.

_set_font() is called to set the font of labels, etc.
  - fonts are selected as strings "name,size".
  - _set_font("") restores the terminal's default font.
  - FIXME >> Return value is never used! << 
  - FIXME >> Should tolerate being passed a NULL font <<

_pointsize() is used to set the pointsize for subsequent points

_flags stores various flags describing driver capabilities.
  - TERM_CAN_MULTIPLOT - driver can do multiplot in interactive mode,
  - TERM_CANNOT_MULTIPLOT - driver cannot multiplot, even if output
    is redirected. (not used by any current driver)
  - TERM_BINARY - output file must be opened in binary mode
  - TERM_ENHANCED_TEXT - terminal is currently in enhanced text mode
  - TERM_NO_OUTPUTFILE - terminal does not use gpoutfile
  See other flags defined in term_api.h

_suspend() - Called before gnuplot issues a prompt in multiplot mode.
   Called only in interactive mode, and only for drivers that have set the
   flag TERM_CAN_MULTIPLOT.  Some of these must flip between text/graphics
   mode (e.g. linuxvga).  X11 driver will take this opportunity to paint
   the window on the display.

_resume() - called after suspend(), before subsequent plots of a multiplot.
   Called only in interactive mode, and only for drivers that have set the
   flag TERM_CAN_MULTIPLOT.

_fillbox() - draws a filled axis-aligned rectangular box. The first
   argument controls the type of fill-in: either a solid color at some
   percentage of full intensity, or a hatch pattern.  Used by plot style
   "with filledboxes" and by the "clear" command (with background as
   fill colour) to do inset plots via multiplot.

_linewidth() - sets the linewidth

The next five functions are used for mouse support, and should be
conditioned on USE_MOUSE:

_waitforinput(int options) - multiplexes mouse and hotkey input with
   reading from the terminal. Returns the next character read from stdin.
   In the mean time, process any mouse events. If the terminal has not yet
   been initialised, this routine should return getc(stdin).

_put_tmptext(int i, const char str[]) - Display temporary text, after
   erasing any temporary text displayed previously at this location.
   The int determines where: 0=statusline, 1,2: at corners of zoom
   box, with \r separating text above and below the point.

_set_ruler(int x, int y) - Draw a ruler (crosshairs) centered at the
   indicated screen coordinates.  If x<0, switch ruler off.

_set_cursor(int c, int x, int y) - Set cursor style and corner of
   rubber band rectangle.  c selects the action: -2=warp the cursor to
   the given point, -1=start zooming, 0=standard cross-hair cursor,
   1=cursor during rotation, 2=cursor during scaling, 3=cursor during
   zooming, -3=draw line between ruler and current mouse position,
   -4=don't draw (erase) line between ruler and current mouse position.

_set_clipboard(const char s[]) - Write a string to the clipboard.


The following four functions support PM3D and RGB colors.

_make_palette(t_sm_palette *palette) - If argument is NULL, return
   number of colors available.  If the number of colors is not limited
   (continuously shaded colors can be generated), return 0.
   Otherwise, allocate the palette.  (t_sm_palette is defined in
   src/color.h.)

_set_color(t_colorspec *colorspec) - EAM November 2004 ***CHANGED***
   This routine used to accept a single double value, which was 
   interpreted as a fractional index into the current color palette.
   Changing the parameter to a colorspec allows terminals to support
   other methods of specifying a color. If a given driver can not
   support a particular color request mechanism, it ignores it.
   If (colorspec->type == TC_FRAC)  (this was the old behavior):
   Set current color according to colorspec->value, where 0 <= value <= 1.
   If using a palette, first map value to an integer i in the interval
   [0...num_colors-1], then set to the ith color in the palette.
   If (colorspec->type == TC_RGB):
   Set current color to the rgb triple given in colorspec->lt.

_filled_polygon(int points, gpiPoint *corners) - Draw a polygon with
   the fill color set by set_color, and no border.  (gpiPoint is
   defined in src/color.h.)

_previous_palette() - Release the palette that the above routine
   allocated and get back the palette that was active before.  Some
   terminals, like displays, may draw parts of the figure using their
   own palette. Terminals that use only one palette for the whole plot
   don't need this routine.

The following 3 functions are required for drivers that support enhanced
text mode. They are called only by the term.c routine enhanced_recursion().

_enhanced_open()   - initialize state variables to process an enhanced text
		     fragment
_enhanced_writec() - write (or buffer) a single character of the text fragment
                     being constructed
_enhanced_flush()  - finish processing of previous fragment and write it to
                     the output stream

_image(unsigned M, unsigned N, coordval *image, gpiPoint *corner, t_imagecolor color_mode)
   Plot a pixel-based image on the display device.
   'M' is the number of pixels along the y-dimension of the image and
   'N' is the number of pixels along the x-dimension of the image.  The
   coordval pointer 'image' is the pixel values normalized to the range
   [0:1].  These values should be scaled appropriately for the output
   device.  The 'image' data starts in the upper left corner and scans
   along rows finishing in the lower right corner.  If 'color_mode' is
   IC_PALETTE, the terminal is to use palette lookup to generate color
   information.  In this scenario the size of 'image' is M*N.  If
   'color_mode' is IC_RGB, successive bytes of the data structure are 
   interpreted as RGB components of a single pixel.  In this scenario
   the size of 'image' is 3*M*N.  The data appears in RGB triples, i.e.,
   image[0] = R(1,1), image[1] = G(1,1), image[2] = B(1,1), 
   image[3] = R(1,2), image[4] = G(1,2), ..., image[3*M*N-1] = B(M,N).
   The mode IC_RGBA is similar except that four values red, green, blue,
   alpha per pixel are passed to the terminal in the image structure.
   The 'image' is actually an "input" image in the sense that
   it must also be properly resampled for the output device.  Many output
   media, e.g., PostScript, do this work via various driver functions.
   To determine the appropriate rescaling, the 'corner' information
   should be used.  There are four entries in the gpiPoint data array.
   'corner[0]' is the upper left corner (in terms of plot location) of
   the outer edge of the image.  Similarly, 'corner[1]' is the lower
   right corner of the outer edge of the image.  (Outer edge means the
   outer extent of the corner pixels, not the middle of the corner
   pixels.)  'corner[2]' is the upper left corner of the visible part
   of the image, and 'corner[3]' is the lower right corner of the visible
   part of the image.  The information is provided in this way because
   often it is necessary to clip a portion of the outer pixels of the
   image.

There is a single entry point associated with support for boxed text.
This option is independent of enhanced text mode.  

_boxed_text() - Called first with option==0 (TEXTBOX_INIT) to initiate
a new text box; subsequent calls to put_text() and/or internal enhanced text
routines including enhanced_flush() accumulate bounding-box limits for this box;
then boxed_text() is called again with option>0 to actually draw
the text box. The option parameter values are
  TEXTBOX_INIT:		 initialize a new text box
  TEXTBOX_OUTLINE:	 stroke the bounding box of the text box
  TEXTBOX_BACKGROUNDFILL: fill the text box with background color
  TEXTBOX_MARGINS:	 adjust whitespace around text to x,y percent of default
It is the responsibility of the term->put_text and term->enhanced_XXX routines
to update the text box if one is active.

_layer(t_termlayer syncpoint)
   Driver-specific synchronization or other layering commands.
   For example, the BEGIN_KEY_SAMPLE/END_KEY_SAMPLE sync points allow
   a driver to respond differently to mouse-clicks on the key sample
   than to mouse clicks elsewhere.
   See term_api.h for defined synchronization points. Any driver that 
   implements term->layer() must silently ignore unrecognized syncpoints.

_path(int p)
   PostScript-like devices make a distinction between the end of a 
   line segment that is internal to a polyline and one that has no
   line-join to another segment.  In order to treat the endpoints of
   a closed polygon as "internal" line-joins, one must bracket the
   polygon segments with "newpath ... closepath". 
   term->path(0) triggers a "newpath"
   term->path(1) triggers a "closepath"
   These calls are optional, and only required by a few drivers.

_hypertext(int type, const char *text)
   Associates a text string with a subsequent graphics object.
   The effect of this association is controlled by type.
   Currently the only type supported is a tooltips-like text popup
   triggered by mousing over the object. Possible future extensions
   include treating the text as a URL activated by mouse click.

_modify_plots(unsigned int operations, int plotno) - used for interactive terminals.
   Apply operations to a single plot or to every plot in the graph.
   Bit definitions in the operations bitmask are given in term_api.h
   and include SET_VISIBLE and SET_INVISIBLE.

_dashtype(int type, t_dashtype *custom_dash_pattern) - set dash/dot 
   pattern independently from linetype. The integer parameter, 
   if non-negative, may refer to the Nth dash/dot pattern pre-defined by
   the specific terminal. The terminal must handle values larger than
   the number pre-defined patterns (e.g. by wrapping around).
   Negative values have special meaning, as defined in term_api.h.
   The t_dashtype parameter can be used to set explicitly defined patterns.
   Alternating numbers in the pattern field of this parameter specify
   dash lengths and spaces between them, in units of the terminal's
   dashlength.


The following should illustrate the order in which calls to these
routines are made:

 _options()
  _waitforinput()	/* If present, may be called before init() */
  _init()
    _scale(xs,ys)
    _graphics()
      _linewidth(lw)
      _linetype(lt)
      _dashtype(dt)
      _path(0)
         _move(x,y)
         _vector(x,y)
      _path(1)
      _pointsize(size)
      _point(x,y,point)
      _text_angle(angle)
      _justify_text(mode)
      _set_font(font)
      _put_text(x,y,text)
         _enhanced_open(fontname,fontsize,base,width,show,overprint)
	 _enhanced_writec(char)
	 _enhanced_flush()
      _arrow(sx,sy,ex,ey)
      _image(M,N,image,corner,color_mode)
    _text()
    _graphics()
      .
    _suspend()
    _set_pointsize()
    _resume()
      .
    _text()
  _reset()


------------------------------------

BITMAP DEVICES

A file bitmap.c is provided, implementing a generic set of bitmap
routines. It provides all the routines required to generate a
bitmap in memory, drawing lines and writing text. A simple driver
need provide only a text() entry point, which converts and outputs
the stored bitmap in the format required by the device.

As of version 4.5, inclusion of bitmap.c and the terminal drivers
that depend on it is controlled by ./configure --with-bitmap-terminals.
This may be desirable because the license for bitmap.c is more
restrictive than the gnuplot license itself, and because the terminals
it supports are mostly obsolete.

Internally, the bitmap is built of one or more planes of 1
bit per pixel. In fact, I think the library would be easier to
use if it offered one or more planes of pixels with 1,2,4 or 8
bits per pixel, since not all bitmap devices are based on planes,
and the planes have to be recombined at the end at present.
In general, a device would use either planes or bits-per-pixel,
though I guess a 24-bit bitmap could use 3 planes of 8 bits
per pixel..?


The pixels are currently organised horizontally packed into bytes.

i.e.

********%%%%%%%%$$$$$$$$!!!!!!!! etc
^^^^^^^^@@@@@@@@########++++++++ etc

where like symbols are stored in one byte. Vertical packing can be
arranged by reversing x and y dimensions and setting the global
b_rastermode to TRUE.  (e.g. Epson 8-pin dot-matrix printer)


Functions provided are

(internal functions ? - should probably be static, not external ?)
b_setpixel(x,y,value)     
b_setmaskpixel(x,y,value)
b_putc(x,y,char,angle)
b_setvalue(size)

setting up stuff

b_makebitmap(x,y,planes)  - make a bitmap of size x * y
b_freebitmap()            - free bitmap
b_charsize(size)


gnuplot driver interface functions  (can go straight into gnuplot structure)

b_setlinetype(linetype)
b_move(x,y)
b_vector(x,y)
b_put_text(x,y,*str)
b_text_angle(ang)



I think that the library could be made easier to use if we defined
a structure which described the bitmap (raster mode, planes, bits-per-pixel,
colours, etc) and then added to the gnuplot term struct a pointer to
this structure. Then we could have b_graphics() routine which did all
the initialisation that presently has to be done by the driver graphics()
entry point.  Also, one day I would like to have parsing, including
terminal driver options, table-driven, but I'm getting ahead of myself
here.

------------------------------------

FILE LAYOUT
-----------

I think a file layout like the following will leave most flexibility
to the gnuplot maintainers. I use REGIS for example.


#include "driver.h"


#ifdef TERM_REGISTER
register_term(regis) /* no ; */
#endif


#ifdef TERM_PROTO
TERM_PUBLIC void REGISinit __PROTO((void));
TERM_PUBLIC void REGISgraphics __PROTO((void));
/* etc */
#define GOT_REGIS_PROTO
#endif


#ifndef TERM_PROTO_ONLY
#ifdef TERM_BODY

TERM_PUBLIC void REGISinit()
{
  /* etc */
}

/* etc */

#endif


#ifdef TERM_TABLE

TERM_TABLE_START(regis_driver)
  /* no { */
  "regis", "REGIS graphics language",
  REGISXMAX, /* etc */
  /* no } */
TERM_TABLE_END(regis_driver)

#undef LAST_TERM
#define LAST_TERM regis_driver

#endif /* TERM_TABLE */
#endif /* TERM_PROTO_ONLY */




#ifdef TERM_HELP
START_HELP(regis)
"1 regis",
"?set terminal regis",
"?regis",
" The `regis` terminal device generates output in the REGIS graphics language.",
" It has the option of using 4 (the default) or 16 colors.",
"",
" Syntax:",
"         set term regis {4 | 16}"
END_HELP(regis)
#endif


--------------

The first three lines in the TERM_HELP section must contain the same
name as that specified by register_term, since this is the name that
will be entered into the list of available terminals.  If more than
one name is registered, the additional names should have their own
two "?" lines, but not the "1" line.

Each record is enclosed in double-quotes and (except for the last
record) followed by a comma.  The text is copied as a single string
into gnuplot.doc, so the syntax must obey the rules of that entity.
If the text includes double-quotes or backslashes, these must be
escaped by preceding each occurrence with a backslash.

Rationale:

We may want to compile all drivers into term.c or one driver at a time
this layout should support both
TERM_PUBLIC will be static  if all modules are in term.c, or blank
otherwise.
Please make private support functions static if possible.


We may include term.h, and therefore all these files, one or more times.
If just once (all modules compiled into term.c) putting the four
parts in this order should make it work.

We may compile the table entries into either an array or a linked list.
This organisation should support both.

For separate compilation, we may write a program which
defines TERM_REGISTER and #include term.h to find out which drivers are
selected in term.h and thereby generate a makefile.



For a driver which depends on another (e.g. enhpost and pslatex on post)
the driver can do something like

#ifndef GOT_POST_PROTO
#define TERM_PROTO_ONLY
#include "post.trm"
#undef TERM_PROTO_ONLY
#endif

this is probably needed only in the TERM_TABLE section, but may
also be used in the body. The TERM_PROTO_ONLY means that we pick up
only the prototypes from post.trm, even if current driver is being compiled
with TERM_BODY or TERM_TABLE

If we do it the linked-list way, the argument to TERM_TABLE_START will be
the name of the variable, so any valid, unique name is fine.
The TERM_TABLE_START macro will do all the work of linking the entries
together, probably using LAST_TERM

The inclusion of the TERM_HELP section (and removal of terminal documentation
from the master gnuplot.doc file) means that the online help will include
discussions of only those terminals available to the user.  For generation
of the printed manual, all can be included.


Please make as many things as possible static, but do still try to use unique
names since all drivers may be compiled into term.o

The bit in the PROTO section is basically what you would put into a .h
file if we had them - everything that is needed by the TABLE_ENTRY
should be defined in this part. In particular, don't forget all the maxes
and character sizes and things for the table entry.

Don't forget to put TERM_PUBLIC in the definitions of the functions as
well as the prototypes. It will probably always expand to 'static'
except for PCs.
